## The Role of AI in Physical AI Systems

In Physical AI systems, the "AI brain" is responsible for processing sensory information, making decisions, and planning actions. This includes:
- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors
- **Localization**: Determining the robot's position in space
- **Mapping**: Creating representations of the environment
- **Path Planning**: Determining safe and efficient routes
- **Decision Making**: Choosing appropriate actions based on goals and constraints

NVIDIA Isaac provides the tools and frameworks to implement these capabilities efficiently using GPU acceleration.

## NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem

The NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:

- **Isaac Sim**: High-fidelity simulation environment for testing and training
- **Isaac ROS**: ROS 2 packages for perception, navigation, and manipulation
- **Isaac Lab**: Framework for robot learning and deployment
- **Isaac Apps**: Reference applications and demonstrations
