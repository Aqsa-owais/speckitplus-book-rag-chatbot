[2025-12-26T14:47:02.439590] Query: What is clean code and why is it important?
Response: The retrieved content does not contain information specifically about what clean code is or why it is important. The content primarily focuses on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) and its applications in robotics, such as enabling components to communicate, designing communication systems, creating simulations, implementing perception and navigation systems, and building cognitive interfaces for human-robot interaction. There is no direct mention or discussion of clean code principles or their significance within the provided excerpts.

For detailed information on clean code, it would be necessary to consult resources specifically dedicated to software development practices and principles.
