# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy and Technical Integrity
All technical explanations must be correct and up-to-date; Content must be verified against official documentation and primary sources; No hallucinated APIs, tools, or features are allowed; If uncertain about technical details, clearly state assumptions.

### II. Clarity and Accessibility
Content must be understandable for beginners to intermediate developers; Use simple, clear English with step-by-step explanations; No unnecessary jargon without proper explanation; Provide clean, readable, and well-commented code examples.

### III. Structure and Organization
Follow a clear, chapter-based book structure; Maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and tone throughout; Create modular chapters that are independently readable; Use proper heading hierarchy and formatting elements where helpful.

### IV. Spec-Driven Development
Every chapter and content piece must align with the project specification; Follow structured workflows using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code; Ensure all deliverables meet defined acceptance criteria; Maintain traceability between requirements and implementations.

### V. Technical Standards Compliance
Markdown must be compatible with Docusaurus; Include proper front-matter for each chapter; Use internal links between chapters when relevant; Code blocks must specify language; Follow Docusaurus folder and file structure best practices.

### VI. Practical Application Focus
Emphasize real-world examples and workflows; Provide hands-on exercises and practical demonstrations; Connect theoretical concepts to actual implementation; Include step-by-step tutorials with clear outcomes.

## Content Standards

### Writing Standards
- Simple, clear English suitable for the target audience (computer science students, junior to mid-level developers)
- Step-by-step explanations with logical progression
- Clean, readable, and well-commented code examples
- Use of headings, subheadings, bullet points, and diagrams where helpful
- Consistent terminology and tone throughout the book

### Technical Requirements
- Format: Markdown (.md/.mdx) compatible with Docusaurus
- Platform: Docusaurus-based documentation system
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages
- Proper front-matter metadata for each chapter
- Correct syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Adherence to Docusaurus folder and file structure

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
- All content must follow the defined specification
- Chapters must be developed iteratively with clear acceptance criteria
- Regular reviews to ensure alignment with project goals
- Testing of all code examples and links before inclusion
- Cross-references and internal linking verification

### Quality Assurance
- Verify all technical content against official sources
- Ensure all code examples compile and function correctly
- Test Docusaurus build process for successful compilation
- Validate internal links and navigation
- Peer review of content accuracy and clarity

## Governance

All contributions must comply with these principles; Amendments require documentation of changes and impact assessment; Content must align with the defined audience and project objectives; All technical claims must be verifiable against authoritative sources; The constitution serves as the authoritative guide for content creation standards.
