response_text: "Created ADR-001 documenting the architectural approach for fixing UI errors in the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book. The ADR captures the decision to implement a systematic debugging approach that addresses component integration issues, error resolution, navigation restoration, and styling consistency while preserving the intended functionality. The decision balances systematic debugging with preservation of intended features."
outcome: "ADR created successfully documenting the architectural approach for UI error fixes. The ADR includes context, decision, alternatives, consequences, and references."
evaluation: "The ADR documents the key architectural decision for the UI error fixing approach with proper context, alternatives considered, and consequences analysis."
